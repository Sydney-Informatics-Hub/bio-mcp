# Sentence embedding models — required for semantic search.
#
# Provides the SentenceTransformer class that loads and runs both:
#   - sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  (fast, general-purpose)
#   - microsoft/BiomedNLP-BiomedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-abstracted (bio domain)
#
# Pulls in torch and transformers as transitive dependencies (~1-2 GB total
# on first install, depending on platform and whether CUDA is available).
#
# BioFinder degrades gracefully if this is absent — search falls back to
# keyword scoring. Remove or comment out this line if you want a lightweight
# install without semantic search.
sentence-transformers>=2.7
